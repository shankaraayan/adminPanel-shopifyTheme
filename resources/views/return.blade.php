		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Return (Money Back/Refund)</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">1. We have a 3 day return policy, which means that you have 3 days after receiving your item/s to request a ‘return’. This means that after 3 days, we will not be able to refund you unless you have emailed/called/messaged us on WhatsApp.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">2. To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it in – undamaged, unopened and unused. You’ll need to clearly demonstrate that the product is in such condition (through photos, videos, or otherwise), and you’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">3. We make exceptions to these rules in very specific rare cases. Please speak to us directly in case you wish to return your item/s after it has been damaged/opened/used.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">4. To start a ‘return’, you can email us at <a href="mailto:hello@vitalityclub.in" style="color:black">hello@vitalityclub.in</a>, or call/WhatsApp us at <a href="tel:8595764867" style="color:black">+91-8595764867</a> between 11:00 AM and 6:00 PM (IST), between Monday and Friday (Except Public Holidays). You can also use the form on our ‘Contact Us’ page: <a href="http://www.vitalityclub.in/contact-us" style="color:black;">http://www.vitalityclub.in/contact-us</a></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">5. Normally, a ‘return’ request is initiated only after we have received an email/phone call/WhatsApp from you, and after we have accepted your request based on our initial inspection and discretion (kindly note that you may be asked to provide evidence, photographic or otherwise, of no damage/usage/tampering in such a case – and we may reject your return request based on our findings at any time during the process). For damaged/tampered/defective products, please read the section below on ‘exchange’. Exceptions to this may be discussed via email or call/WhatsApp.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">6. A ‘return’ generally comprises of you sending back to us the product that you had received, in return for the money that you had originally paid. The product in question must be undamaged/unused/unopened. In certain rare cases, we do accept return (money back) requests after the product has been opened and tested by consumption. For such cases, please contact us and we will tell you what to do next.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">7. If your return request is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label (via email or WhatsApp or otherwise), as well as instructions and details on the return pickup. Kindly note that, you will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable (both ways – i.e. from us to you, and back from you to us). If you receive a refund, the costs of two-way shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">8. Please be aware that while we may initially accept your return request (based on initial evidence provided by you, such as photos/videos etc. – i.e. if the product appears in the initial photos etc. to be unused/undamaged/unopened at the time of successful reception by the customer – i.e. if the product was received well by the customer, as demonstrated initially by the photographic or other evidence), we still reserve the right to overturn our initial decision upon physically receiving and inspecting the product/s (for e.g. - if we find that the product has been deliberately tampered with, consumed or damaged by the customer, after we had initially accepted the ‘return’ request). In such a case, we will contact you regarding the next steps. Generally, in such a case, we will engage in an ‘Exchange’ process – wherein we will send you an identical replacement product. To know more about our ‘Exchange’ process, continue to the relevant section further below. Furthermore, depending on the prevailing conditions, we may instead be able to only offer you in-store credits in place of a full-fledged refund or exchange. Terms and conditions apply.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">You can always contact us for any return question at <a href="mailto:hello@vitalityclub.in" style="color:black">hello@vitalityclub.in</a>, or via call/WhatsApp at <a href="tel:8595764867" style="color:black">+91-8595764867</a> (Monday to Friday, 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM IST – Except Public Holidays).</p>
		<p class="text1">(Please note that we reserve the right to refuse any return request.)</p>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Damages and Issues</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">1. Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the packet is defective, damaged, or the seal is broken. In such a case, we strongly recommend that you email/WhatsApp us the image/s or the video/s of the damaged packaging.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">2. Kindly note that since we offer a 3 day ‘return’ and ‘exchange’ window, we generally do not accept claims of damage or quality disputes after this window expires.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">3. Kindly also note that you may be asked to provide pictures or videos as evidence of damage from or at the time of reception, along with proof of your purchase or any other form of evidence.</p>
		<p class="text1">4. Please note that we reserve the right to refuse any return or exchange request.</p>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Exceptions and Non-Returnable/Non-Exchangeable Items</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">1. Unfortunately, we have no mechanism to return a gift card, nor can we exchange or refund a product for which you do not have an invoice or proof of purchase (digital or printed).</p>
		<p class="text1">2. Furthermore, the products which are sold on special discounts, and/or are specifically marked as non-returnable, shall not be returned once sold. Please get in touch with us if you have questions or concerns about your specific item via email at <a href="http://www.vitalityclub.in/contact-us" style="color:black;">hello@vitalityclub.in</a>, or via call/WhatsApp at <a href="tel:8595764867" style="color:black">+91-8595764867</a> (Monday to Friday, 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM IST – Except Public Holidays).</p>
		<p class="text1">(Please note that we reserve the right to refuse returns/exchanges based on our discretion – especially for certain consumable products owing to health, hygiene, and safety standards.)</p>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Exchange (Product Replacement)</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">1. We have a 3 day exchange policy, which means that you have 3 days after receiving your item/s to request an ‘exchange’. This means that after 3 days, we will not be able to exchange your item/s, even if they were ‘damaged on arrival’, unless you have emailed/called/messaged us on WhatsApp.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">2. We only exchange items if they are defective, tampered or damaged upon reception (i.e. damaged/defective/tampered on arrival – simply referred to henceforth as ‘damaged on arrival’), and if you receive a defective, tampered or damaged product, kindly send us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@vitalityclub.in" style="color:black">hello@vitalityclub.in</a>, or call/WhatsApp us at <a href="tel:8595764867" style="color:black">+91-8595764867</a> (Monday to Friday, 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM IST – Except Public Holidays) and we will tell you what to do next. You can also use the form on our ‘Contact Us’ page: <a href="http://www.vitalityclub.in/contact-us" style="color:black">http://www.vitalityclub.in/contact-us</a></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">3. We make exceptions to these rules in very specific rare cases. Please speak to us directly in case you wish to exchange your item/s even if it has not been tampered/damaged, or even if it has been opened and consumed for testing.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">4. Normally, an ‘exchange’ request is initiated only after we have received an email/phone call/WhatsApp from you, and after we have accepted your request based on our initial inspection and discretion (kindly note that you may be asked to provide evidence, photographic or otherwise, of damage/tampering/defect in such a case - and we may reject your exchange request based on our findings at any time during the process). For undamaged/unopened/unused products (or when you may simply want to change the SKU or flavour or variant or size etc.), please read the section above on ‘return’.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">5. An ‘exchange’ generally comprises of us sending you the exact same product or products (with the exact same or lower value) at no additional cost (except additional courier charges – if deemed to be applicable), while you send us back the product that you had initially received. The product/s in question must be damaged/used/tampered. In certain rare cases, we do accept exchange requests after the product has been opened and tested by consumption, or even if it is not ‘damaged on arrival’. For such cases, please contact us and we will tell you what to do next.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">6. If your exchange request is accepted, and after we receive and inspect the item/s ourselves, and are satisfied with our findings, we will send you a replacement at the earliest. Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.</p>
		<p class="text1">7. Please be aware that while we may initially accept your ‘exchange’ request (based on initial evidence provided by you, such as photos/videos etc. – i.e. if the product appears in your photos/videos etc. to be accidentally damaged/tampered/defective on arrival – i.e. if your evidence demonstrates that the tampering or damage occurred from our end or by our delivery partners, a.k.a. ‘damaged on arrival’), we still reserve the right to overturn our initial decision upon physically receiving and inspecting the product/s (i.e., if we inspect the product/s and find that it has been deliberately tampered by you - the customer - after the delivery had been successful and satisfactory, or if it has been significantly consumed by you - the customer – after the delivery, or if it has been made deliberately unsafe/unhygienic by you - the customer -, or if it is a case of fraudulent claim etc.; after we had initially accepted the ‘exchange’ request). In such cases, we will contact you regarding the next steps. Generally, in such cases, we offer in-store credits that become accessible only after a thorough review by our team, and only after a pre-defined period of time has passed.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">You can always contact us for any return question at <a href="mailto:hello@vitalityclub.in" style="color:black">hello@vitalityclub.in</a>, or via call/WhatsApp at <a href="tel:8595764867" style="color:black">+91-8595764867</a> (Monday to Friday, 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM IST – Except Public Holidays).</p>
		<p class="text1">(Please note that we reserve the right to refuse any ‘exchange’ request. Please also note that in case you want to return your current product and exchange it for a different product – such as a different size or flavour or value etc. – then you will be required to request for a ‘return’ on the original product, and purchase the new product separately. All ‘return’ related terms and conditions remain the same in such a case and you may read more in the section above, and we reserve the right to refuse any return request.)</p>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Refunds</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.</p>
		<p class="text1">We have no channel to return cash collected on delivery, hence our customer service agents will reach out to you with detail instruction to submit your preferred online remittance for processing your refund against the cash collected on delivery.</p>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Late or Missing Refunds (If Applicable)</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">If you haven’t received a refund yet, kindly contact your credit card company, as it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.</p>
		<p class="text1">If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@vitalityclub.in" style="color:black">hello@vitalityclub.in</a> or via call/WhatsApp at <a href="tel:8595764867" style="color:black">+91-8595764867</a> (Monday to Friday, 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM IST- except public holidays).</p>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Shipping Address</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">To return/exchange your product, you should mail your product to:</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">Candid India (Vitality Club)<br/>A1/76, 1st Floor<br/>Safdarjung Enclave<br/>New Delhi<br/>110029<br/>India</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for ‘returning’ your item. Shipping costs (both ways – i.e. from us to you, and from you back to us) are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund. Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.</p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">In some cases, the customer is also responsible for bearing the shipping cost/s of ‘exchange’ items. Usually, such a condition will be conveyed in advance, or during the exchange process.</p>
