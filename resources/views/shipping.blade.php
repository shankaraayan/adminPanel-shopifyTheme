		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Shipping</b></p>
		<ol>
		    <li><p class="text1 mb-0">At Vitality Club, we partner only with reputed national courier service providers.</p></li>
			<li><p class="text1 mb-0">Our shipping charges vary depending on your order value/weight and location, however, for orders that are eligible for ‘Cash on Delivery’, there is an additional surcharge above and beyond the regular shipping charge. This rate is always mentioned during the checkout process, and it may be updated, modified or removed from time to time without prior notice.</p></li>
			<li><p class="text1 mb-0">You will be provided the shipping charges prior to making your final payment and/or placing your final order (also true if you opt for cash on delivery).</p></li>
			<li><p class="text1 mb-0">Shipping charges are subject to change without prior notice. However, the updated shipping charges will be mentioned on the ‘checkout’ page at all times so that you can make an informed decision.</p></li>
			<li><p class="text1 mb-0">Because our products are made in small batches with artisanal and seasonal ingredients, shipping times may vary.</p></li>
			<li><p class="text1 mb-0">While we strive to ship your order at the earliest, our products are usually shipped within 3 working days of receiving an order. Working days exclude public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays, and a working day ends at 6:00 PM – meaning if an order is placed after 5:45 PM, then it will be processed the next morning after 11:00 AM, and its shipment will take place within 3 working days starting after the processing has occurred. Similarly, if an order is placed after 5:45 PM on a Friday, then it will be processed after 11:00 AM on the coming Monday (unless there is a public holiday or an unforeseen ‘Act of God’), and its shipment will take place within 3 days starting from Monday. Furthermore, the shipping times may vary due to any unforeseen ‘Act of God’ (‘Force Majeure’).</p></li>
			<li><p class="text1">As soon as your package ships, we will email you your package tracking information.</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Delivery</b></p>
		<ol>
		    <li><p class="text1 mb-0">Our courier partners will be able to deliver the shipment to you between Mondays through Saturday: 9am to 7pm.</p></li>
		    <li><p class="text1">Delivery time is subject to factors beyond our control including unexpected travel delays from our courier partners and transporters due to weather conditions, strikes, or any Act of God (‘Force Majeure’).</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Order Tracking</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">If you're a logged in user, or if you already have an account with us, simply head to the 'My Orders' section in your account to track your order. If you shopped as a guest, you must create an account with us using the SAME email ID that you had initially used to shop. This can be done from: <a href="http://www.vitalityclub.in/register" target="_blank" style="color:black">http://www.vitalityclub.in/register</a></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">Should you have any questions about your order dispatch, we’re just a quick email, phone call or WhatsApp away:</p>

		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Can two separate orders be combined to reduce shipping?</b></p>
		<p class="text1">Unfortunately, once your orders are placed we cannot combine multiple orders due to regulatory and compliance issues. Shipping will be applicable on every new order (if it does not fall under the free shipping criteria).</p>
		
		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Shipping Terms & Conditions</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">We cannot cancel part of your order and ship the rest. You can request us within 24 hours of placing your order to cancel it, and you can then place a revised new order via our website. Any payments done online via net banking/UPI/credit or debit card etc., will be refunded back to you at the earliest. You may contact our customer service agents via email, phone call or WhatsApp:</p>

		<p class="text1 mb-0"><b>Cancellations</b></p>
		<p class="text1 mb-0">We will be able to accept order cancellation requests within 24 hours of your order being initially placed. Unfortunately, we cannot cancel orders once the shipment is out of our warehouse for delivery. To cancel your order, you can call, email or WhatsApp us:</p>
		<p class="text1"><a href="tel:918595764867" style="color:black">+91-8595764867</a> | <a href="mailto:hello@vitalityclub.in" style="color:black">hello@vitalityclub.in</a> | MON - FRI | 11:00 AM - 6:00 PM IST (Except Public Holidays)</p>
